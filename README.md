In this project I created a sale data analysis of a commercial store.  

To create a sales data analysis for a commercial store, we need to focus on several key aspects:
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather data on sales transactions, including dates, products sold, quantities, prices, and customer information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data by summarizing its main characteristics and visualizing trends.
Key Metrics Calculation: Calculate important metrics such as total sales, average order value, customer segmentation, product performance, etc.
Data Visualization: Create charts and graphs to make insights easily understandable.
Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights and recommendations.

Here's an outline of the analysis:

1. Data Collection and Preparation
We'll assume we have the following sales data for a store:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Date: Date of the transaction.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.
Product Category: Category to which the product belongs.
Quantity Sold: Number of units sold in the transaction.
Price: Price per unit of the product.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We'll start by loading and previewing the data to understand its structure. Then, we'll perform some basic statistics and visualizations.

3. Key Metrics Calculation
We'll calculate the following key metrics:
Total Sales: Sum of all sales revenue.
Average Order Value (AOV): Average amount spent per order.
Total Orders: Number of orders.
Total Customers: Number of unique customers.
Sales by Product Category: Total sales revenue for each product category.
Monthly Sales Trend: Sales trend over months.
Top Selling Products: Products with the highest sales volume.

4. Data Visualization
We'll create visualizations for:
Sales trend over time.
Sales distribution by product category.
Top selling products.
Customer segmentation based on sales.

5. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we'll derive insights and make recommendations for improving sales, optimizing inventory, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
